# Dad-Joke-Generator
Click a button. Get a Dad joke! (With bonus facepalm gif).

A simple page that calls on the icanhazdadjoke api to fetch a random dad joke and return it to the user.

At the same time, it used to Giphy API to fetch a gif from the search 'facepalm', selected one of the 50 returned gifs at random, and return that image next to the joke.
