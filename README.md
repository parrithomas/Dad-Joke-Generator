# Dad-Joke-Generator
Click a button. Get a Dad joke! (With bonus facepalm gif).

A simple page that calls on the icanhazdadjoke API to fetch a random dad joke and return it to the user.

At the same time, it uses the Giphy API to fetch a gif from the search term 'facepalm', return 50 results (max for dev key), selected one of the 50 returned gifs at random, and return that image alongside the joke.

Hilarity ensues.
